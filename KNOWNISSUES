* If you are using a local repository mirror and your slapt-getrc file
  points to file:/// repositories instead of http:// or ftp://
  repositories, salix-codecs-installer-gtk will not function properly
  and throw an error saying that you don't have the correct permissions
  to write to the repositories. The command line versions,
  salix-codecs-installer will function just fine in this case anyway.
